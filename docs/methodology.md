# Methodology

This case study follows the Google Data Analytics process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act**.

## Ask
Defined the business task: identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members to support membership growth strategies.

## Prepare
Used the public Divvy/Cyclistic trip dataset for a continuous 12-month period (June 2022 – May 2023). Documented sources and constraints.

## Process
Applied validation and cleaning rules (timestamps, rider type, positive duration) and created derived time fields (day/hour/month) and ride duration.

## Analyze
Aggregated trips and ride durations by rider type and by time dimensions (day of week, hour of day, month).

## Share
Produced summary tables and exported charts suitable for inclusion in a case study report.

## Act
Next phase will translate insights into specific, actionable marketing recommendations.
